You know how annoying it is to search your candidate database
when it contains very diverse human entered location strings.

Consider just a few pertaining to New York City:

		"New York, NY", "100 church street new york",

		"New York, NY", "Utica, New York Area",
		"New York, NY", "greater new york city area",

I still see two flies in the ointment just in those few lines.
Anyway, pareto principle, good enough for unpaid own business.

This .GO code shows some heuristics how I approached the task,
